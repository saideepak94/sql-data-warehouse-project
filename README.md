# 🏗️ SQL Data Warehouse Management Project

## 📘 Project Overview  
The **SQL Data Warehouse Management Project** is designed to collect data from multiple sources such as datasets, files, and web scraping.  
The collected data is then inserted into a **SQL Data Warehouse**, where it undergoes various **transformations** to make it **ready for business analytics**, including **dashboard creation** and **advanced analysis** like **machine learning**.

## 🧩 1. What is a Data Warehouse?  
A **Data Warehouse (DW)** is a **central storage system** where data from different sources (such as Excel files, databases, web scraping, APIs, etc.) is collected, cleaned, and organized.  
This structured data can then be easily used for:
- Reporting  
- Business intelligence dashboards  
- Data analysis  
- Machine learning applications  

---

## ⚙️ 2. What is Data Management?  
**Data Management** refers to the process of **collecting, storing, cleaning, maintaining, and securing data** within databases or a data warehouse.

Without proper data management, we may face several challenges such as:
1. Increased time to generate reports  
2. Slow and inefficient processes  
3. Higher chances of **human errors**  
4. Lack of up-to-date data (data inconsistency)  
5. Inability to generate **integrated reports**  
6. Difficulty handling large amounts of raw data  

To overcome these issues, I have implemented a **Data Warehouse system** that automates data handling and ensures clean, reliable, and structured data for analysis.

## 🔄 3. ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)  

I used the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** methodology to build the Data Warehouse.

### 🧮 Extraction  
- Used **Push Extraction**, where data is directly pulled from the source systems into the Data Warehouse.  
- Performed **Full Extraction** to transfer entire datasets at once from various **files and web sources**.

### 🔧 Transformation  
Applied multiple **data cleaning and transformation techniques**, including:
- Handling missing values (NULLs)  
- Removing duplicates  
- Formatting and standardizing data  
- Adding additional columns for table joins  
- Ensuring consistent data structure for business analysis  

### 📤 Load  
After transformation, the **cleaned and structured data** was loaded into the Data Warehouse and made **ready for business purposes** such as reporting and visualization.

## 🏛️ 4. Data Architecture  

There are four main data architectures:
1. **Data Warehouse** – Best for structured data and reporting (✅ *chosen for this project*)  
2. **Data Lake** – Used for all types of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured); suitable for advanced analytics and ML  
3. **Data Lakehouse** – A combination of Data Warehouse and Data Lake for flexibility  
4. **Data Mesh** – A decentralized approach to data ownership  

### ✅ Why I Chose Data Warehouse  
The main objective of my project is to make data **ready for dashboards and reports**.  
Since the collected data is **structured**, the **Data Warehouse** architecture is the most suitable choice.

## 🧱 5. Medallion Architecture  

I implemented the **Medallion Architecture**, which consists of **three layers**:  
**Bronze → Silver → Gold**

---

### 🥉 Bronze Layer  
- Raw data from various source files is first collected and **directly loaded** into the Data Warehouse **without any modifications**.  
- Keeping the raw data intact ensures we always have a **backup copy** in case of data loss during later transformations.  
- Studied the **origin, importance, and structure of data** at this stage.  
- Designed a database with **three schemas** and created **six DDL scripts**.  
- Data was inserted using the **BULK INSERT** method into Bronze tables.

---

### 🥈 Silver Layer  
- Stores **cleaned and transformed data**.  
- Created six new tables to store processed data.  
- Operations performed include:
  - Removing duplicates  
  - Handling null values  
  - Formatting and standardizing data  
  - Adding additional columns for joining tables  
- The transformed data was then loaded into **Silver tables** for further processing.

---

### 🥇 Gold Layer  
- In the Gold Layer, I **joined related tables** from the Silver layer to create **final, business-ready datasets**.  
- These datasets are optimized for **report generation** and **dashboard building**.

---

## 🚀 6. Final Output  
After completing all three layers:
- Data is **clean, structured, and reliable**  
- It can be used directly for:
  - Business intelligence reports  
  - Interactive dashboards  
  - Advanced analytics and machine learning

## 🧰 7. Technologies Used  
- **SQL Server / MySQL** – for Data Warehouse  
- **Python** – for data collection and transformation  
- **Web Scraping** – for extracting data from websites  
- **ETL Pipeline Design**  
- **Medallion Architecture Implementation**  

---

## 🧠 8. Key Learnings  
- Understanding **data warehouse design and implementation**  
- Building ETL pipelines  
- Performing **data transformations** effectively  
- Structuring data for **business intelligence and analytics**
